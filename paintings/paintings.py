#  Input
#  The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases that follow.
#
#  The first line of each test case contains one integer N where N is the number of colors/vertical strips 
#  Catherine wants her painting to have. On the second line are 
#  colors ordered in (strictly) decreasing order of preference, where each color is a string of between 1 and 20 lowercase 
#  lowercase letters (aâ€“z). The third line contains a positive integer M
#  indicating the number of pairs of colors that follow. Each of the next 
#  lines contains two space-separated colors Ci and Cj
#  such that Catherine does not like seeing color Ci next to color Cj. No pair of colors will appear on more than one line.
